# Github Trends

The script shows 20 most excited GitHub repositories with their issues's urls about week

# How to Install

Python 3 should be already installed. Then use pip (or pip3 if there is a conflict with old Python 2 setup) to install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt # alternatively try pip3
```
Remember, it is recommended to use [virtualenv/venv](https://devman.org/encyclopedia/pip/pip_virtualenv/) for better isolation.

# Quickstart

Launch on Linux or Windows as simple
```bash
$ python github_trending.py
